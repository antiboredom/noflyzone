        Rule One: Every rule has an exception, but no one is sure what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every day IATA (International Air Transport Association) publishes an
        updated set of rules from member states defining who is and isn’t
        permitted to enter the respective countries under various Covid-19
        lockdown regimes. Each day this list grows longer with contronyms,
        paradoxes, and complex, seemingly arbitrary sub-clauses that produce
        multifold exceptions. The more information-rich this schematic becomes
        the less legible it is. Occasionally, new parameters clash with prior
        parameters and apparently contradictory guidelines are obtained. Some
        rules disappear entirely without explanation. This is a process by which
        an explicit and temporary state of exception becomes an overt and
        semi-permanent anomaly that is integrated in the normal run of quotidian
        life. A condition in which the definitive interpretation of the rule
        belongs solely to those who impose it. While observing the process of
        global reterritorialization doesn’t always make clear who is and isn’t
        permitted to cross which borders, the overarching mechanisms and ensuing
        chaos that produces the state of exception becomes briefly traceable.
