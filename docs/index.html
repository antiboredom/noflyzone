            Rule One: Every rule has an exception, but no one is sure what it
            is.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every day IATA (International Air Transport Association) publishes
            an updated set of rules from member states defining who is and isn’t
            permitted to enter the respective countries under various Covid-19
            lockdown regimes. Each day this list grows longer with contronyms,
            paradoxes, and complex, seemingly arbitrary sub-clauses that produce
            multifold exceptions. The more information-rich the schematic
            becomes, the less legible it is. Occasionally, new parameters clash
            with prior parameters and apparently contradictory guidelines are
            obtained. Rules disappear entirely and new rules appear overnight.
            This is a process by which an explicit and temporary state of
            exception develops into an overt and semi-permanent anomaly that is
            integrated in quotidian life, a condition in which the definitive
            interpretation of the rule belongs solely to those who impose it.
            While observing the process of global reterritorialization doesn’t
            always make clear who is and isn’t permitted to cross which borders,
            it does provide a genealogy of the process by which information
            outlaws are created.

            No Fly Free Zone is an automated live broadcast of the individual
            nation state travel restrictions as published by the IATA. The
            broadcast is continuous and is updated perennially to incorporate
            changes as they become available on the IATA website. Download the
